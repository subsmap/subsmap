# Land Subsidence Map of Iran

<https://subsmap.github.io> provides a webGIS visualization of the land subsidence map of Iran estimated using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from Sentinel-1 data. This visualization uses data from the supplementary material to the paper "Haghighi and Motagh, 2024. Uncovering the Impacts of Depleting Aquifers: A Remote Sensing Analysis of Land Subsidence in Iran, Science Advances". The dataset offers valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in fields such as land subsidence and groundwater depletion. Original data is freely available at <https://zenodo.org/record/10815577>.
